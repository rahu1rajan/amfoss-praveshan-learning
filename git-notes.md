# Git and GitHub Notes

## What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code during software development. It helps manage code history and allows multiple developers to collaborate efficiently.

## What is GitHub?
GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories and provides tools for collaboration, version control, and project management.

## Key Git Commands I Learned:

- `git init`  
  Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.

- `git status`  
  Shows the current state of the working directory and staging area.

- `git add <filename>` or `git add .`  
  Adds files to the staging area. Using `.` adds all changes.

- `git commit -m "message"`  
  Saves the staged changes with a message describing the commit.

- `git branch`  
  Lists all branches in the repository.

- `git remote add origin <repo_url>`  
  Links the local repository to a remote one (GitHub).

- `git push -u origin main`  
  Pushes the changes to the `main` branch of the GitHub repository and sets it as the upstream branch.

## What I Understood:
- Git helps me manage my code and its history.
- GitHub makes it easy to collaborate and store code online.
- Using Git through the terminal gives me full control over my project.
